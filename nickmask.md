## Message Proxying Functionality
 Allows a user to send messages using Fletcher as a proxy, similar to the functionality of Tupperbox or Pluralkit.

Demo:
```
# Direct message the below to Fletcher.
[8:33]<Cain> !preference tupper textbrackets #(Replace 'textbrackets' with a proxy prefix of your choice.
[8:33]<Fletcher> textbrackets
[8:34]<Cain> !preference tupper-nick-textbrackets Nickname #(Replace 'Nickname' with a nickname of your choice.)
[8:34]<Fletcher> Nickname
[8:35]<Cain> !preference tupper-avatar-textbrackets https://linktoimage/ #(Replace `https://linktoimage/` with an image of your choice.)
[8:35]<Fletcher> https://linktoimage/
[8:36]<Cain> !preference prefer-tupper 1 #This line is optional. It sets Fletcher to prefer Tupperbox first, allowing you to use Fletcher proxying as a backup only when Tupperbox is down or not present. If you do not use Tupperbox, or would prefer to use Fletcher, this line does not need to be included.
```
